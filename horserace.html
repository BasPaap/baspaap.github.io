    De tweede editie van <em>Syndicaat</em> speelde zich af op een renbaan, tijdens de opening van het paardenrace-seizoen.

    Every horse had certain characteristics that determined how fast it went and for how many seconds, and when it accelerated or decelerated. There is a certain element of randomness to this as well, so we as the organization had no idea which horse would win either.

    However, it wouldn't be a mob story if we didn't facilitate a certain amount of tampering. If you had the right connections, you could influence if a horse would run faster or slower than normally in either lap, enabling players to "fix" the races. This could be manipulated right up to the start of a race.

Atmosphere-wise, we combined a bunch of 1930's city skyline images and some buildings from existing racetracks to use as a backdrop. Eagle eyed players may have spotted the Brooklyn Bridge or the Ulver and Empire Bay buildings from Mafia 2. For sound, we used some generic crowd and horse gallop sounds, and a heavily muffled and edited version of Travis Stone's calling of the 2018 Kentucky Derby, found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyZ0RtCZABA&t=52s. We muffled the sound because the idea was that people were watching the race from inside, and as such the calls outside would be muffled. This had the added advantage that you couldn't really hear any of the horse names, and that it would sound appropriate regardless of what was actually going on on-screen.
